How to use the recent option.

(1.) Create a post or page and add recent to your short code. 
shortcode sample : 
[gallery id='recent@ 12, 23, 34'] will pull the most recent post from each of the 3 categories, 12, 23, and 34.
[gallery id='recent: 12, 23, 34'] will pull the most recent post from all categories excluding the categories, 12, 23, and 34.
[gallery id='recent'] will pull the most recent post from all categories.


(2.) Multiple shows on one page will continue to work as expected.

Note: If you want to show more than one recent post from each category you will need to change the default setting under: superslider-show/settings: advanced, Limit recent number of posts.
